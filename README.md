# Portfolio-Analysis-Derivatives-Research

# Project Overview
A dual-part project featuring a quantitative Portfolio Analysis (CAPM/Beta) using Excel and a research report on the evolution of Derivative Markets and the 2008 Financial Crisis.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two distinct sections:
1.  **Quantitative Analysis:** Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and CAPM calculations.
2.  **Research Report:** An analysis of derivative instruments (Futures, Options, CDS) and their role in the 2008 Financial Crisis.

# Part I: Portfolio Analysis & CAPM (Quantitative)
File: Financial Market TABA Excel Spreadsheet - 24198170.xlsx

This section utilizes historical data (6-year period) for **IBM**, **General Motors**, **S&P 500** and **T-Bills** to perform the following calculations:
**Risk & Return:** Calculation of annualized expected returns and standard deviations (volatility) for individual assets.
**Correlation Matrix:** Analysis of covariance and correlation coefficients to assess diversification benefits.
**Efficient Frontier:** Construction of the **Feasibility Set Curve** to visualize the risk-return trade-off for a two-asset portfolio (IBM & GM).
**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):** Calculation of **Beta** for IBM and GM against the market benchmark (S&P 500) to determine required rates of return.

# Part II: Derivative Markets & Financial Crises (Qualitative)
File: Portfolio Analysis Derivatives Research.pdf

A comprehensive research report analyzing the evolution, mechanics and systemic risks of derivative markets.

# Key Topics Covered:
**Futures & Forwards:** The history of futures markets, the role of exchanges and the mechanics of margin accounts and "Marking to Market."
**Options Contracts:** Distinctions between forward, future and option contracts including valuation approaches.
**Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** The history and operation of CDS markets.
**The 2008 Financial Crash:** A critical analysis of how unregulated derivatives (specifically CDS) and excessive leverage contributed to the systemic collapse of 2007-2009.

# Tools & Skills Used
**Financial Modeling:** Excel (Variance-Covariance method, Linear Regression for Beta).
**Investment Theory:** Modern Portfolio Theory, CAPM, Efficient Market Hypothesis.
**Risk Management:** Analysis of systemic risk, liquidity risk and counterparty risk in OTC markets.
